## Description

Graph rewiring techniques are used to modify the structure of graphs used to train models such as GNNs and graph transformers. However, rewiring inherently alters the structural properties of the graph, possibly distorting important structural-based information. In this paper, we offer insight in to what structural metrics are critical to remain invariant across rewiring techniques to support the future creation of effective graph rewiring methods. Our approach compares the magnitude of change in various structural metrics across six different rewiring techniques to the classification accuracy of a GNN on the rewired graphs. 

## How to play with Metric Rewiring Playground

This notebook (`Metric_Rewiring_Playground.ipynb`) is a playground for you to experiment with different rewiring techniques and see how they affect the structural properties of the graph by evaluating different spectral and spatial metrics.

## Automate Google Sheet Setup API Google Developer Console

Please follow the following [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-automate-google-sheets-with-python/) to at **least** generate your API key. The rest should be automated and ready to function in `analysis/metric_analysis.ipynb`.

✅ You are not ready to run and analyze the results of the rewiring techniques.
